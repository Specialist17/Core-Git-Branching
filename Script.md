## Plot

Fernando woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally Fernando would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Fernando’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Fernando had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Fernando would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

As he walked through the path, Fernando felt the smell intensifying. He started hearing what might have be confused with the sound of a horse, but this was different. He saw a black majestic beast, with a colored horn, and golden hair galloping around at the end of the path. Fernando got close to it with awe and admiration, and started expressing his amazement. The beast got startled, and started talking back. Fernando got surprised, but kept talking back to the beast. The beast identified itself as teh Unicorn King. Fernando met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers.

The end.
